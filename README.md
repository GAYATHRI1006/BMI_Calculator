BMI = weight / (height in meters)^2

- Classification:
- BMI < 18.5 â†’ Underweight
- 18.5 â‰¤ BMI < 24.9 â†’ Normal weight
- 25 â‰¤ BMI < 29.9 â†’ Overweight
- BMI â‰¥ 30 â†’ Obese

- Input validation is done using RegExp: `/^\d+$/` for numeric inputs.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js** (Functional Components + Hooks)
- **CSS** (Custom styles in `App.css`)
- **JavaScript** for validation and calculation logic
